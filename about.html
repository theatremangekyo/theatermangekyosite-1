    <h2>What is "Mangekyo"?</h2>
    <p>Mangekyo is Japanese for kaleidoscope. A union of complex, intricate patterns in a constant flux--we think it represents the members perfectly. We are unique in our own ways and are always evolving as individual people, as a member of society, as a community. </p>
    <h2>Our Theatre Approach</h2>
    <p>The goal of devising is to develop something new and authentic. The artists involved don’t have one specific task or role - all “ensemble members'' are actors, writers, designers, and directors. Using source material as a starting point, we do writing prompts, drawing and image building, and lots of improvisation to tease out the kinds of stories we want to tell and how we want to tell them. We try our best to create a safe space for the ensemble members to reflect, share, and exchange ideas. This highly organic process allows the characters and story to reflect many perspectives and lived experiences from ensemble members. We all collectively develop and create the artistic vision of the piece. </p>
    <p>For the workshop performance, we used Japanese mythology as our source material. We chose Japanese mythology in order to gain a better understanding of Japan. Folklore can provide a unique window into a society and its values.</p>
    <p>However, the piece is not a retelling of Japanese mythology, but merely a starting point used to express the idea that while Japan may seem mono-cultural at first glance, it has a rich, diverse range of people that call it home.</p>
    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Theatre Mangekyo has, as it’s foundation, the following objectives:</p> 
    <ol>
      <li>To strive for inclusion and representation in both our members and the content of our work.</li>
      <li>To create high quality, bold, thought-provoking works that invite discussion, reflection, and exploration of what it is to be a member of Japanese society.</li>
      <li>To make the work accessible to a wider audience through bilingual content (English and Japanese), while aiming further to expand the languages we present our work in.</li>
      <li>To create human connections in a disconnected world both within the community of the project and beyond through our work, our social media, and our website.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We strive to achieve these objectives through first collecting first-hand experiences from a diverse group of people in Japan and developing stories that show different perspectives, while also presenting themes that are common to all as human beings. We aim to create pieces that are both enjoyable and moving- that motivate action, both internal and external. In the stories we tell, we hold respect and truthfulness as our highest standard. It is our hope, that through our work, audiences may find opportunities for reflection, and through that reflection discover new things about themselves and Japan. Conversations about social change are of value in all countries and contexts; we aim to plant seeds that may provoke such conversations.</p>
